# Overview
Welcome to <strong>CataFax<strong>! This project seamlessly integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an entertaining and dynamic experience. Harnessing the capabilities of these technologies, I've designed a user-friendly interface with a spotlight on JavaScript functionalities, providing a delightful way to discover random cat facts with each button press.
